This project is a Proof of Concept of a decentralized secret management solution that leverages Internet Computer (IC) technology to compete with existing applications such as 1Password, Doppler or Hashicorp Vault.
Our project aims to provide means for services to share secrets in a flexible, transparent and secure way. It simplifies the flow of secret management between consumers in the cluster as well as rotate secrets based on config for added security.
In the future we want to keep building on top of what we have now by adding support for various secret types, adding more specialized sidecars as well as improve the distribution methods.
