# ICP Vault üîë :lock: Initial Research 

## :space_invader: Problem Definition
Customers face challenges in the secret management market due to complex deployment processes, high costs, vendor lock-in, security concerns in centralized systems, and limitations in customization and integration options. A new solution is needed to provide a user-friendly, secure, and cost-effective secret management experience that addresses these pain points while offering flexibility and adaptability to varying user needs.

From the point of view of customers, the current secret management market has several pain points and challenges that need to be addressed:


* **Security concerns**: In a centralized secret management system, customers may have concerns about data privacy and security, as there is a central point of failure and potential for data breaches.
* **Complex deployment and setup**: Customers often struggle with the time-consuming and complicated process of setting up and configuring secret management solutions, especially for organizations and enterprises.
* **High costs and vendor lock-in**: Some secret management solutions come with high costs, including licensing, maintenance, and professional services fees. Additionally, customers may face challenges in migrating to other solutions due to vendor lock-in.
* **Limited integrations:** Many secret management solutions have limited compatibility with other platforms, tools, and services, hindering seamless workflows and creating inefficiencies for users.
* **Inconsistencies in user experience**: Users may face inconsistencies in user experience across different platforms (desktop, web, mobile), leading to confusion and inefficiencies in secret management tasks.
* **Insufficient support and community resources:** Users often encounter inadequate customer support, especially for free users or specific user groups, and may find limited community resources for troubleshooting and learning.
* **Customization limitations:** Organizations with unique requirements may face difficulties customizing existing secret management solutions to meet their specific needs, leading to suboptimal implementations.

Zondax aims to develop a decentralized secret management product utilizing Internet Computer (ICP) technology to compete with existing solutions such as 1Password, Doppler, and Hashicorp Vault (among others). 

The product will offer a secure, decentralized infrastructure that eliminates the need for locally stored secrets, with the potential to evolve into a tokenized DAO. it will prioritize user experience, addressing common complaints about the complexity of AWS/GCP and the poor user experience of HCP.

## :chart_with_upwards_trend: Market Trends

* **Cloud adoption:** As more organizations migrate to the cloud, there is an increasing demand for cloud-native secret management solutions that integrate seamlessly with cloud platforms, such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.
* **Automation and DevOps integration:** With the rise of DevOps and CI/CD practices, there is a growing need for secret management solutions that can integrate with various DevOps tools and automate secret provisioning, rotation, and access management.
* **Zero-trust security:** Organizations are adopting zero-trust security models, which assume no inherent trust in any user or system. This trend drives the demand for secret management solutions that provide granular access controls, multi-factor authentication, and encryption.
* **Compliance and regulatory requirements:** As data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and HIPAA become more stringent, organizations need secret management solutions that help maintain compliance by providing access controls, audit logs, and data protection features.
* **Containerization and microservices:** The increasing adoption of containerization and microservices architectures leads to the need for secret management solutions that can securely manage secrets across distributed environments and dynamically provision secrets for containerized applications.
* **Open-source and community-driven solutions:** There is a growing interest in open-source secret management solutions that offer transparency, flexibility, and community-driven development, allowing organizations to customize and adapt the solution to their specific needs.
* **Multi-cloud and hybrid environments:** With organizations increasingly adopting multi-cloud and hybrid environments, there is a need for secret management solutions that can manage secrets across various platforms and on-premises systems seamlessly.
* **Decentralization and blockchain technology:** Emerging trends in decentralization and blockchain technology offer new opportunities for developing secure, transparent, and resilient secret management platforms that leverage the benefits of distributed systems.
* **Passwordless authentication and Passkey:** As organizations move towards more secure and user-friendly authentication methods, passwordless authentication and Passkey technology are gaining popularity. These methods, such as biometric authentication or single-use authentication codes, reduce the reliance on traditional passwords and the risks associated with password reuse or weak passwords.
* **Machine learning and AI-based security:** The integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence in secret management solutions can help detect anomalies, identify potential threats, and automate security responses, enhancing the overall security posture of the system.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) access:** Organizations are adopting JIT access policies, granting users temporary access to secrets only when needed and automatically revoking access once the task is completed. This minimizes the risk of unauthorized access and reduces the attack surface.
* **Secrets-as-a-Service ‚ÄúSaaS‚Äù? :** The increasing demand for on-demand, scalable, and managed secret management solutions has led to the rise of Secrets-as-a-Service offerings. These services provide a cloud-based, fully managed secret management platform, reducing the need for organizations to maintain their own secret management infrastructure.
* **Unified secret management platforms:** As organizations manage various types of secrets, such as API keys, passwords, certificates, and encryption keys, there is a growing trend towards unified secret management platforms that can manage all secret types within a single, centralized solution.
* **Increased focus on user experience:** Secret management solutions are prioritizing user experience by designing intuitive interfaces, simplifying workflows, and offering seamless integrations with commonly used tools and platforms. This makes it easier for both technical and non-technical users to manage secrets effectively.
